 * NDHU and NDM are in units of boards (16 lines each).
 * LOWDM is the unit number of the first unit with a DM-11
 * (e.g. 16 if the first DH has no DM, the second does have one).
 * All units from LOWDM through LOWDM + (NDM*16) are assumed to have
 * modem control (bit 0200 must be on in
 * their minor device numbers if DH_SOFTCAR is defined).
