Running Demos Commander on Xenix console you may use terminal
types 'ansi' or 'xenix'. In fact, Terminal type 'ansi' is not
true ansi description, but is adjusted to Xenix console.
If you are running real ansi device, you must use TERM=trueansi.

To setup terminal type, use:

	$ TERM=termtype
	$ export TERM

in shell, or

	% setenv TERM termtype

in cshell.

5. Adding a new terminal type.

Demos Commander handles a terminal using a terminal capability
database termcap. Commander has its own termcap appendix
/usr/lib/deco/termcap, which is read before standard /etc/termcap.
Indirections tc=name in deco's own termcap refer to the
entry 'name' in the default terminal database. You can use 
your own terminal database instead of the default /etc/termcap.
To do this, set the global variable TERMCAP to the full
name of your file (for example, TERMCAP=/usr/my/termcap).

Demos Commander uses the following termcap entries.
See termcap(M) for additional information.

in the following order: horisontal line, vertical line,
lower left corner, lower center, lower right corner,
left center, center cross, right center,
upper left corner, upper center, upper right corner.

6. Known problems with this Release

Cannot enter non-ascii character into command string. Use
'run subshell' command to do this, then type 'exit' and
return to deco.

No color setup in this version.

Cannot set file sorting criteria. File names are always sorted
by extensions.

Cannot set language from Options menu. Use MSG variable instead.

Cannot set global variables from deco, because each command
is executed in separate shell. Use 'Exec shell', set variable,
then type 'exec deco'.
